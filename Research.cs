// A developer would use a linked list when frequently inserting and removing items especially in large quantities. 
// A developer would do so to avoid low performance. 

// A stack has elements that follow the behavior last it - first out. Only the most recently added element can be removed.
// A queue has elements that follow the first in- first out behavior. Elements are added at the end of the queue and taken from the front. 

// A situation in which a developer would use a stack is undo. The last change made within a program is removed.

// A situation where a developer would use an array over a list is when a data set is a fixed size and the developer wants to optimize performance.
